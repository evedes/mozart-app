### 01. What is Mozart Metrics all about?

  Mozart Metrics is a self-contained docker web app that you can launch on a linux box / home server and that will collect metrics.
  You will have the possibility to create your own dashboards and chart all the available interfaces and resources as you wish.

  NOTE: This app is being developed as a side project so don't expect it to grow quickly.

  Main focus: 
    
    - collect system metrics

    - collect network inferface metrics
